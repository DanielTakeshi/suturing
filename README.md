# Fast Surgical Suturing

The goal of this project is to do some fast surgical suturing. We should submit
a paper before the Spring 2018 semester ends.

Look at the individual repository READMEs, which have LOTS of detail.

This does NOT do any calibration whatsoever. Use the debridement repository for
that. (Edit: see the `calibration` directory, as we need to do some basic stuff
here. Fortunately, for this, only the position is actually needed.)
