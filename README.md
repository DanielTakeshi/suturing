# Fast Surgical Suturing

The goal of this project is to do some fast surgical suturing. The goal is to
submit to IROS 2018, due March 1, 2018.

Look at the individual repository READMEs, which have LOTS of detail.

This does NOT do any calibration whatsoever. Use the debridement repository for
that.
