# Scripts

Just look at the top of each python file for usage and expected output.

## Important

- `evaluate.py` for evaluating my code. I NEED TO GET THIS WORKING TO SHOW THAT
  MY METHOD IS WORKING.

- `automatic_data_collection.py` for automatic data collection of images that
  consist of needles and grippers in some environment.


## Quick Testing

- `needle_images.py` and `sandbox_first.py` are sandbox/quick testing files.


## Other

- `utils.py` for utilities.
