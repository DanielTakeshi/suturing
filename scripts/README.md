# Scripts

Just look at the top of each python file for usage and expected output.

## Important

- `evaluate.py` for evaluating my code. I NEED TO GET THIS WORKING TO SHOW THAT
  MY METHOD IS WORKING.

- `automatic_data_collection.py` for automatic data collection of images that
  consist of needles and grippers in some environment.



## Surgical Suturing Primitive

- **TODO** get Brijen's code here and test it to better understand the failure
  cases.



## Analytic Modeling

- Use `analytic_model.py` to get an analytic model of the needle tip position. I
  use the setup as shown below:

  ![setup](images/setup_analytic_1.JPG?raw=true)

## Quick Testing

- `needle_images.py` and `sandbox_first.py` are sandbox/quick testing files.



## Other

- `utils.py` for utilities.
