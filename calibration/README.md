# Calibration

Here, we use a specific calibration setup where we try and map from camera
points to  **the actual center of the tool frame**, and not just the tip, as we
were doing before. This actually makes my job easier because only one fixed
rotation is needed, and we don't have to record that as all we need is to insert
the needle inside the rectangles.
